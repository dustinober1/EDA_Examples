# Electric Vehicle Population Data Analysis

## Overview
This directory contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Electric Vehicle Population data with over 257,000 vehicle registration records. The analysis has been fully executed and tested, providing valuable insights into EV adoption patterns, geographic distribution, and market trends.

## Files
- `Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv` - Raw dataset (257,635 records, ~60MB)
- `comprehensive_ev_eda.ipynb` - Complete Jupyter notebook with analysis ✅ **Fully Working**
- `findings.md` - Key findings and insights summary
- `README.md` - This file

## Status: ✅ Complete and Working
All analysis cells have been executed successfully. The notebook includes robust error handling and alternative visualization methods for maximum compatibility.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset contains 17 columns with information about:
- **Vehicle Identification**: VIN, DOL Vehicle ID
- **Geographic Data**: County, City, State, Postal Code, Vehicle Location coordinates
- **Vehicle Specifications**: Make, Model, Model Year, Electric Vehicle Type
- **Performance Metrics**: Electric Range, Base MSRP
- **Regulatory Information**: CAFV Eligibility, Legislative District
- **Infrastructure**: Electric Utility, 2020 Census Tract
